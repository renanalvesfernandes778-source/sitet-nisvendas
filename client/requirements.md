## Packages

lucide-react | consistently used for icons
react-intersection-observer | To trigger animations on scroll
embla-carousel-react | For the product image carousel if needed (optional but good for e-com)

## Notes
- Images are provided in @assets/
- The goal is high conversion, so I will focus on a sticky CTA, clear value proposition, and urgency.
- The form submits to /api/leads.
